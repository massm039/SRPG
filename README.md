java rpg

This is a strategy RPG using point-and-click elements for dialog and plot development.

Written in Java using the lightweight java game library and the slick addon.

I wrote this to further my understanding of java and game engines. It uses a 3 layered tile based system,
basic saving to text files, an implemented map editor, and the A* pathfinding algorithm.
