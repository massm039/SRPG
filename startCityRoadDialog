Enter_Combat_You see a man standing on a bridge. The town behind him is a mess._Man: Don't come any closer! This area is off limits._Daniel: But the old man didn't say anything about that._Man: It's not his business._A shriek can be heard from the slum behind the man. He turns to look at the noise, then turns back at you, and draws his weapon.
