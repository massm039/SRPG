Daniel_OldDrawers_Daniel: Some old drawers. I left the key here last night. I added a Basement Key to my inventory.~Daniel_OldDresser_Daniel: This cabinet is so old, but pretty sturdy. It has probably been passed down a few generations.~Daniel_RedWoodShelf_Daniel: It's a nice shelf, but there is nothing on it except a few cobwebs and a stain or two.~Daniel_Bed_Daniel: It sure was nice of that old man to let us sleep here.
